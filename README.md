# Project overview
* The project aims to develop a digital healthcare platform that connects all hospitals under one unified system. Each citizen will have a personal health account that stores their complete medical history, including medications, chronic conditions, prescriptions, laboratory tests, and radiology documents. The platform will allow hospitals and doctors to instantly access a patientâ€™s records using their national ID, ensuring continuity of care and reducing medical errors.
