# Project overview
* Medicatory is a digital health platform designed to centralize and organize a patient's complete medical history in one secure and accessible place.
* The project aims to solve major challenges faced by patients and doctors in Egypt, where healthcare records are scattered, inconsistent, or unavailable during consultations.
* Through user research, competitive analysis, and system mapping, Medicatory proposes a modern digital solution that improves communication, diagnosis accuracy, and overall medical experience.

# Project objectives:
# Objectives for Patients
* Provide a unified, secure Personal Health Record (PHR) system.
* Offer access to all medical records anytime, anywhere.
* Reduce forgetfulness through reminders for medications, tests, and appointments.
* Allow instant and secure sharing of medical history with doctors.
* Improve treatment outcomes by eliminating lost or incomplete information.

# Objectives for Doctors
* Ensure access to accurate, verified, and updated medical histories.
* Reduce time wasted gathering patient information.
* Support diagnosis through structured summaries and interaction alerts.
* Provide an intuitive dashboard for reviewing past records and making informed decisions.
* Enhance patient–doctor communication and follow-up quality.

# Objectives for the Healthcare Ecosystem
* Support digital transformation in healthcare aligned with Egypt's 2030 vision.
